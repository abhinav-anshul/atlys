# Atlys Project

This is an Atlys assignment.

Tech Stack used - Vite + TypeScript + React + Wouter + Tailwind

## Decisons Taken
- Vite : Small library with efficient bundling, better in terms of performance when compared to webpack/create-react-app.
- TypeScript : Goes well with modern-day JS development, good for catching errors even for smaller projects.
- React : Project
- Wouter : This is a tiny ~2kb alternative to `react-router`. Although, `react-router` is much more powerful, `wouter` is perfect for smaller projects of this size.
- Tailwind : Best for Quick prototyping to full-scale frontend projects, saves time on classname with near zero compile time in prod.

## About the Project
- It has roughly 3 routes
    - `/dashboard` : This is the feed dashboard from the figma design that consists of `CreatePost` and `Post` component.
    - `/login` : This will render the page with `login` component.
    - `/signup` : This will render the page with `signup` component.
